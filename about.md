Hello! I'm a photographer who specializes in street, events, and landscapes. I started taking it seriously about six years ago and haven't looked back.

When I'm not taking photos, I'm [building websites], playing tennis, listening to good music, and much more.

FAQ:

1. Are you taking on clients?

- Not at the moment, but I've worked with clients before.

2. How did you make this site?

- I built it using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript, and for the time being it's hosted on Netlify. If you're curious, you can check out the Github repository [here.]

3. What cameras do you use?

- I primarily use a Nikon d700 (I absolutely love it!) and I have a d7000 as a backup. I've also used my Samsung phone a few times.

4. Lenses?

- A 50mm f/1.8, a 28-75mm f/2.8, and a 70-200mm f/2.8. The 70-200 is my preferred portrait lens.

5. What editing software do you use?

- I edit with Capture One but used to use Lightroom. I use Photoshop with making edits that I can't do with Capture One.

6. Got any photography tips?

- If you're doing street photography, stand at a 20 degree angle away from the subject. After you take your pic, pretend that there's something wrong with your camera (stare at if a few times, look confused, etc). I've been doing street photography regularly for over a year and it's still pretty nerve-wracking, so it's thanks to tricks like these that it's getting easier.

7. Photographers who inspire you?

- I have a bunch of favorites: Emily Garthwaite, Renee C. Byer, Aristides Economopoulos, Alan Schaller, Irving Penn, Steve McCurry, Yousuf Karsh, Dorothea Lange, and Henri Cartier-Bresson.
